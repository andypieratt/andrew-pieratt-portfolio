# andrew-pieratt-portfolio

## Description

With this project, I began creating a portfolio that will higlight some of my favorite projects and accomplishments. This is the rough-draft and I plan on continuing to add to it as I learn more tools and skills throughout this boot-camp.

-My motivation for making this project is to have a working and user-freindly portfolio that I can share with future employers.
-I learned a lot throughout this project mainly through the CSS realm by being able to use button to link to external sources, image centering and the importance of media queries when dealing with varying viewports.
